        <h1>
          Adam Nagy is an artist.
        </h1>

        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          Adam Nagy also believes that everyone is an artist, only
          some
          artists never realize that they are making art.

        <p>
          Adam Nagy could be considered to be a hipster but Adam Nagy
          doesn’t believe in labels. Adam Nagy lives in a reality that fascinates itself with by coming up with new
          labels. Adam Nagy has made a Virtual Reality experience called “Free Shipping” where only labels exist.
          Adam Nagy overthinks things, like what does it feel like to be Adam Nagy. Adam Nagy wakes up in the morning
          and makes himself coffee, because even after quitting for 2 months after 7 years of continuous addiction
          coffee tastes better than sleeping. Adam Nagy knows that he’s not alone, it’s just that people don’t share
          coffees in the morning anymore. To create bridges between people Adam Nagy makes videos and music - for
          YouTube, for his band, for himself.
          Adam Nagy challenges you to pronounce his last name, but he is okay with you calling him Ne-ghi.
