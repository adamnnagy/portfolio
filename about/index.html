                    Adam Nagy is an artist.

                    Adam Nagy also believes that everyone is an artist, only some artists never realize that they are making art.

                    Adam Nagy could be considered to be a hipster but Adam Nagy doesn’t believe in labels. Adam Nagy lives in a reality that fascinates itself with by coming up with new labels. Adam Nagy has made a Virtual Reality experience called “Free Shipping” where
                    only labels exist. Adam Nagy overthinks things, like what does it feel like to be Adam Nagy. Adam Nagy wakes up in the morning and makes himself coffee, because even after quitting for 2 months after 7 years of continuous addiction
                    coffee tastes better than sleeping. Adam Nagy knows that he’s not alone, it’s just that people don’t share coffees in the morning anymore. To create bridges between people Adam Nagy makes videos and music - for YouTube, for his band,
                    for himself. Adam Nagy challenges you to pronounce his last name, but he is okay with you calling him Ne-ghi.
